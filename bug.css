The CSS property `content` is used with the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements to insert generated content.  However, using it incorrectly can lead to unexpected rendering issues. For example, forgetting to set a `display` value on the pseudo-element can result in the content not being visible.  Another issue is using an invalid value for `content` such as referencing a non-existent counter or using incorrect Unicode characters.
